# Evergreen Content Strategy — Eastern Kentucky News
> Generated: 2026-02-26  
> Prepared for: Eastern Kentucky News

---

## Executive summary
This evergreen strategy is tailored to Eastern Kentucky News — a local news site covering Kentucky counties, schools, events, obituaries, local government, and community life. The goal: grow reliable organic traffic and community utility by building pillar resources, county hubs, and evergreen how-to and data pages that retain value over months and years.

## 1. Content Audit

### What's working
- Strong local focus: dozens of category pages (county, schools, obituaries, sports) are aligned with high-intent local queries.
- Existing technical structure: site is already modular (county pages, components) enabling scalable hub pages.
- Variety of pages: news, features, and utility pages present good raw material to convert into evergreen assets.
- Tests and services in codebase indicate maintainability and ability to add data-driven features.

### What's not working
- Many thin/short news posts that age quickly and lack evergreen value.
- Likely keyword cannibalization across county and category pages (multiple posts about the same local event/topic).
- Missing or inconsistent pillar/hub pages (no clear “ultimate” resource per county or topic).
- Weak resource pages for recurring search intents: how to find public records, school calendars, local permits, and obituaries index.
- Limited long-form guides, glossaries, or evergreen explainers for topics unique to the region (mining, local courts, county services).

### Content gaps and missed opportunities
- County hub pages: consolidated guides for residents and visitors (services, demographics, news highlights).
- Schools & districts resources: evergreen guides for enrollment, calendars, sports schedules, scholarships.
- Obituaries & public records: searchable, well-structured indexes + how-to content for funeral planning, historical obits.
- Events & tourism: perennial guides for festivals, hunting/fishing, state parks, and rural tourism drives.
- Local business and economy: “how business works in county X” — resources for entrepreneurs and small business SEO.
- Data-driven evergreen content: interactive maps, crime trends, school performance dashboards (high value).

### Pages to update, consolidate, or remove
- Update: county pages, county-quick-facts, schools pages, editorial-policy, privacy/robots/meta.
- Consolidate: multiple short event posts into an evergreen “annual events” + per-event historical pages.
- Remove/Archive: truly ephemeral duplicates (one-line announcements) or merge them into a historical archive page.
- Add: Resource hub pages (FAQ, glossary, how-to), and a canonical obituaries index page.

### Quick wins vs. long-term plays
- Quick wins (0–3 months)
  - Optimize titles/meta for top-performing county pages and speakers (add county modifiers).
  - Create a canonical “County Quick Facts” template for consistent schema and OpenGraph.
  - Publish 3 county hub pages for highest-traffic counties.
  - Consolidate repeated event posts into single landing pages.
  - Add structured data for articles and local business/organization pages.
- Long-term plays (3–12+ months)
  - Build a Resource Hub (how-to, public records, school guides, legal resources).
  - Invest in interactive data tools and county dashboards.
  - Produce investigative or guide series with backlinks (education funding, economic transition).
  - Build partnerships with local institutions for link-building (libraries, chambers).

## 4. Site Architecture & Where to Add Content

### Pages and sections that need new content
- Per-county hub pages (top priority for top 8 counties by traffic/population).
- Resource Hub: How-tos, public records, legal forms, school enrollment guides.
- Events index (annual): recurring and historical event pages.
- Obituaries index with filtering and evergreen memorial guidelines.
- Glossary & FAQ pages (region-specific terms and civic processes).
- Landing pages for major beats (Education, Courts, Business, Environment).

### Recommended site sections
- /county/[county-name]/ — County hub
- /schools/ — Schools hub, subpages per district
- /resources/ — How-tos, public records, forms
- /events/ — Annual and evergreen event pages
- /obituaries/ — Searchable obits index + memorial resources
- /glossary/ — Region-specific definitions
- /data/ — Dashboards, maps, interactive tools
- /about/ — Community and mission + editorial policy

### Site structure and content hierarchy recommendations
- Top navigation: Home | Counties (dropdown) | Schools | Events | Resources | Data | About
- Sidebar on county and school pages: key links: hub, schools, events, obituaries, businesses, contact.
- Breadcrumb and canonical tags on all hub/spoke pages.
- Use a clear URL structure: /county/[county-name]/[topic] — consistent slugs.
- Add schema.org LocalBusiness/NewsArticle/Event/FAQ/Person where appropriate.

### Internal linking strategy
- Link every county-specific article to its county hub (primary canonical).
- Every hub should link to 8–12 best spokes (schools, parks, events).
- Use contextual links within articles to relevant guides (e.g., an event post links to parking & lodging guide).
- Add inline “Related” modules showing older evergreen pages and the county hub.
- Ensure each new article includes 2–4 internal links to relevant pillars/hubs.
- Remove or canonicalize duplicate pages to avoid cannibalization.

## 5. SEO Strategy

### Keyword research approach for evergreen topics
- Seed with local modifiers: [keyword] + [county], [city], “KY”, “near me”, “school district”.
- Use long-tail queries: “how to request public records in [county] ky”, “[county] school enrollment 2026”.
- Tools/process: Google Search Console (top queries), local keyword tools (Semrush/Ahrefs/Keywords Everywhere), People Also Ask scraping, and site search logs.
- Priority mapping: match topics to user intent (informational, navigational, transactional).
- Map keywords to pillar pages first, then to spokes (avoid duplicating target keywords).

### On-page SEO checklist
- [ ] Target primary keyword in title (<60 chars) and near beginning
- [ ] One H1 only; include target keyword
- [ ] Use H2/H3 for structured subtopics; include secondary keywords naturally
- [ ] Meta description with keyword and local modifiers (120–160 chars)
- [ ] URL slug includes main keyword and county (if applicable)
- [ ] First 100 words include the primary keyword and clear intent
- [ ] Use lists and tables where helpful (improves scannability)
- [ ] Include internal links to pillar/hub pages and 2–3 relevant spokes
- [ ] Add Schema.org markup appropriate to content (Article, FAQ, Event, LocalBusiness)
- [ ] Optimize images: descriptive filenames, alt text with keywords, lazy-load
- [ ] Add published & updated dates for transparency
- [ ] Add strong CTA and contact info on hub pages
- [ ] Ensure mobile-first accessibility and fast load (compress images, lazy load)
- [ ] Implement canonical tags and pagination where needed
- [ ] Set social/OpenGraph tags and Twitter cards

### Featured snippet and People Also Ask optimization tips
- Provide direct answer boxes: short, clear answers (40–60 words) near top of page.
- Use FAQ schema for Q&A sections with concise answers (40–100 words).
- Use numbered steps for procedural queries (how-to) and tables for comparison queries.
- Add “common questions” near top of hub pages constructed from PAA queries.
- Monitor PAA and iterate headings to match exact question phrasing (include verbatim Qs as H2/H3).

### Content length and depth guidance
- County hub pages (pillar): 1,500–3,000+ words with clear sections and expandable modules.
- How-to guides & legal/public records: 1,000–2,000 words with step-by-step checklist and examples.
- Listicles/local guides: 800–1,500 words.
- Event pages: 600–1,200 words + structured schedule and repeating yearly updates.
- Data-driven dashboards: explanatory write-up 800–1,500 words + visualization.
- Prioritize quality, structured data, and user-focused headings over raw word count.

### Keyword cannibalization prevention
- Create a keyword map: one target keyword per URL; track primary/secondary keywords.
- Consolidate similar posts into a single authoritative page and 301 older URLs to it.
- Use canonical tags when multiple similar pages must exist (e.g., per-year event pages).
- Use internal linking and anchor text to signal the canonical hub page.

### Link-building angles for evergreen content
- Local institutions: partner with county government, libraries, chambers to link guides.
- Schools & PTAs: syndicate school calendar pages and resource guides.
- Nonprofits & service orgs: co-create guides (volunteer directories) and earn links.
- Local directories & tourism boards: list hub pages and event pages.
- Data stories: use original data to pitch regional and state outlets for backlinks.
- Resource link outreach: email roundups to local bloggers and civic organizations.
- Sponsor local events or provide co-branded content for cross-promotion.

## 7. 3-Month Content Roadmap

Publishing cadence recommendation:
- Month 1: Focus on foundations — 1 pillar hub + 2 high-impact how-to pages + 2 regional event or school pages. Cadence: 2–3 publishes/week while working on hub updates.
- Ongoing (Months 2–3): 2 posts/week (1 hub/spoke or long-form + 1 short evergreen/local guide). Publish one data-driven piece or interactive tool by Month 3.

Flag: Month 1 priorities are marked with "PRIORITY".

---

## Production & Workflow Recommendations

- Use a content brief template for every article and require internal linking fields in briefs.
- Assign owners for county hubs (reporter/editor responsible for updates).
- Set review cycles: update hub pages quarterly and event pages annually (or as dates change).
- Track performance: add UTM tags for major campaigns, monitor GSC queries and clicks weekly.
- Implement templates in CMS for counties and resource pages to ensure schema and consistent metadata.

---

## Measurement & KPIs

Primary KPIs:
- Organic users from local searches (GSC clicks and impressions)
- Time on page and returning users on hub pages
- Number of internal links pointing to hubs
- Conversions: newsletter signups, submissions (obituaries, tips)

Quarterly targets (example):
- Month 3: Increase organic clicks for targeted counties by +25% (baseline from GSC)
- Build at least 15 high-quality internal links into hubs
- Earn 3 local institutional backlinks (library, chamber, school)

---

## Templates & Checklists

### Quick PR outreach template (short)
- Subject: Local resource for [County] — would you link?
- Body: Hi [Name], we published a comprehensive guide to [County] services that may help your audience. Quick link: [url]. Would you consider listing/linking it on your resources page? — [Reporter Name], Eastern Kentucky News

### Short editorial checklist (publish)

- Verify schema & FAQ markup
- Add internal links to hub + 2 related spokes
- Add meta description and OG image
- Run accessibility and mobile test
- Set canonical and publish date
- Add to site map and ping search console

---

## Implementation priorities (first 90 days)
1. Build 3 top county hubs (Month 1).

3. Implement FAQ schema on hub pages and add structured data across site (Month 1–2).
4. Create an Obituaries index and implement search/filter (Month 2).
5. Produce a data-driven interactive county services map (Month 3).

---

## Final notes
